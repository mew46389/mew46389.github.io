	<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Modern cross stitch is more than a domestic skill your grandmother practices in her free time. It is an art form that requires time, patience, practice, and a great deal of talent. Today, artists have taken the craft to a level beyond the traditional scope of cross stitch, reaching heights that were previously beyond the realm of possibility.</span></p>

			<td>Severija Incirauskaite-Kriauneviviene</td>
			<td>Incirauskaite-Kriauneviviene is a Lithuanian based artists who cross stitches on unconventional medium. She sews on car hoods, metal buckets, doors, fences, etc. The hard, rusty edges of metal medium juxtaposed with the soothing, cozy appeal of stitched craftwork make for a very beautiful and unique art style. . She does not try to use contrasting thread on her medium. Rather, she attempts to extenuate the beauty of the item she is cross stitching by blending the thread seamlessly with the material (Fulleylove).Image Source: https://theinspirationgrid.com/embroidered-objects-by-severija-incirauskaite-kriauneviciene/</td>

			<td>Jose Romussi</td>
			<td>Romussi is a self-taught Chilean artist. To extenuate the beauty and grace of the human form, he embroiders black and white photographs with bold, bright thread to create eye-popping, energetic patterns. Romussi enjoys giving people a peek into what might lie beyond the image captured in a photograph, extrapolating and giving the audience more than what they see with the naked eye. He “interrupts the norm” of artistry and “redefines notions of beauty while simultaneously drawing attention to social issues” (Goldberg; Yellow Owl).
