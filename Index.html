<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Cross stitch is a subsection of embroidery that consists of variations of X-shaped stitches sewn on a grid-like, woven fabric. Such fabrics may include, but are not limited to, Aida, linen, or Monk’s cloth (Fitzgerald). The many cross stitch fabrics vary in look, feel, and count, which “refers to the number of threads or squares per linear inch in the material” (Barwick). Therefore, each fabric is best suited for a particular project. Before selecting a fabric, it is important to do research into what fabric would best suit a project, and often, this is personal preference (Cross Stitch Fabrics 101).</span></p>
<p class= "p2"><span class= "s1">The overarching craft of embroidery has been in practice for thousands of years. In fact, the first samples of embroidery have origins in Ancient Egypt. Later, embroidery made its way to China and Russia through tea trading routes. The craft was very popular during the Tang dynasty is China, 618-906 AD (Verso). Eventually, embroidery came to the western world with the creation of the Bayeux Tapestry, which depicts the Norman Conquest of England in 1066 (Samara et al.)</span></p>
<p class= "p2"><span class= "s1">Cross stitch is a much younger subsection of embroidery, thought to be truly invented between 1100-1492. While the technique was used in the past, Islamic states began using cross stitch to create small, repeating patterns on grid-like pieces of cloth (Samara et al.). “The Islamic civilization of the Moors” influenced cross stitch in Spain (Verso). Cross stitch eventually found its way from Spain to Britain when Catherine of Aragon, the first wife of King Henry the VII, adorned her husband's clothes with the small, embroidered pattern. King Henry exemplified the height of British fashion at the time, which led to the growing popularity of cross stitch in Britain. Cross stitch's popularity soon manifest itself in literature, and the first cross stitch book was published in 1524. These books were extremely popular, so much so that cross stitch books became "one of the first mainstream publications within England" (Samara et al). Cross stitch and other forms of needle work were eventually taught to girls in school. Needlework became more decorative and was often displayed to exemplify a young ladies craft skills and talent (Verso).</span></p>
<p class= "p2"><span class= "s1">However, in the 19th century, the popularity of cross stitch began to decline. The German wool trade flooded English markets with cheaper materials (Verso). Furthermore, with the invention of personal sewing machines, cross stitch became less popular all over the world. During World War I, thread became very expensive, which further extinguished the practice of cross stitch. In World War II, cross stitch took a similar blow among civilians, however, POWs (prisoners of war) found themselves cross stitching to pass the time and even to encrypt anti-Nazi messages (Samara et al.)</span></p>
<p class= "p2"><span class= "s1">After the World Wars, people found themselves with more free time, and cross stitch eventually grew in popularity once again in the 1960s. In the 1980s, new materials were invented for fabric and thread with the popularity of the hobby sewing market (Samara et al.). Today, cross stitch is used in many forms, both as a domestic skill as well as a form of artistic expression. We see influences from video games, pop culture, subcultures, and so many other facets of life. Cross stitch can be seen on traditional material like linen or Aida and clothing. However, modern cross stitch has been taken to a level unlike any other in history</span></p>
<p class= "p2"><span class= "s1">Cross stitch is no longer confined to strict rules of thread and fabric. Designs can be made on just about anything. Artists such as Severija Incirauskaite-Kriauneviviene, Danielle Clough, and Jose Romussi have elevated the craft to display the fact that cross stitch is not an art that must be limited. For more information on these artists and their work, please click <a href= "The Art of Cross Stitch.html">HERE.</a></span></p>
<p class= "p2"><span class= "s1"> Furthermore, it is true that embroidery and cross stitch remain very popular staples in fashion. Many Millennials and those who identify as Gen Z embroider on social media, showing their skills by embroidering denim items specifically. Easy-to-understand cross stitch kits can be bought at any craft store or super store for roughly $5-$7. Of course kits are not necessary to cross stitch. Needles, fabric, and embroidery hoops can all be bought separately to accommodate the buyers personal preference. There even exists pattern design software that allows anyone to create their own cross stitch pattern.</span></p>
<p class= "p2"><span class= "s1">In conclusion, cross stitch is a timeless craft that has been in practice for hundreds of years. It can be used as a domestic skill, to garnish clothing, to exemplify needlework talent, and/or as an artistic outlet. Modern interpretations of cross stitch have broadened the uses of the craft and brought new life into this subsection of embroidery. </span></p>
